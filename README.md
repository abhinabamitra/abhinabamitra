<h3 align="center">I am an enthusiastic learner who wants to explore many technical skills.</h3>

I am Abhinaba (Shivam) from Siliguri, West Bengal and currently pursuing my B.Tech in Information Technology (IT) from Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore üè´.

Being interested in computers since a young age, it feels wonderful to solve problems with the tools that just fit your hands.
Made significant progress from a novice to self-learning new and  interesting technologies and implementing them in projects.
Eager to be challenged in order to provide simple and efficient solutions.
Enthusiastic to  learn new technologies as the need arises and improve my skills.
